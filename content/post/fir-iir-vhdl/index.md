>This project is done during my time as a Digital System course lecturer assistant.

## Background

During my 5th semester of undergraduate study, I taught Digital Systems as a lecturer assistant. My responsibilites included teaching and supervising students' projects. One of the classes I taught required an implementation of FIR (finite impulse response) and IIR (infinite impulse response) filters. 

As a result, I implemented an order 7 FIR filter and an order 6 IIR filter in VHDL, both with 8-bits of inputs and outputs. 

## Result

The VHDL files of the implementation can be inspected on [Github](https://github.com/richardmedyanto/DigitalSystem)
