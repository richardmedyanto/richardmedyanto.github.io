## Summer Course

As a Binus ASO student, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a summer course in Fukuoka, Japan, during the summer of 2023. This event had been eagerly anticipated since the beginning of the semester on campus, and it truly lived up to expectations.

The summer course was made possible through a collaboration between Binus University in Indonesia and ASO College in Japan, and I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the curriculum. We engaged in hands-on lessons covering topics such as car transmission, car engines, airbags and safety devices, as well as mechanical design and manufacturing.

The off-campus experiences were equally delightful, including visits to museums, shrines, and a factory tour. Moreover, classes focusing on Japanese manners and the Japanese work experience offered valuable insights into life in Japan, enhancing our overall understanding and appreciation of the culture.

## FA Support Internship

The summer course also included a month-long internship program. The company I interned at is called FA Support (ＦＡサポート), a Japanese industrial automation company. The internship began before the summer course had started. We were briefed about the requirement of the project, which was to make an automated tray dropper concept. The output of this project was a 3D design and presentation of our concept. During the summer course, we presented our work to the company president and other staff members, who were kind enough to give feedback about our creations, which prompted several improvements for the final presentation. Overall, this internship was a short but interesting experience.
