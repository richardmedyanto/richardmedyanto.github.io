## üßë Profile

Second-year Master's student at National Taiwan University, focusing on heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) and currently doing research in the fabrication and characterization of radio-frequency InP-based HBT. Actively involved in device processing and measurement, while also learning advanced simulation techniques using Silvaco TCAD and device design tools. My broader interests span across optoelectronic devices, light-emitting transistors (LETs), and the integration of electronic and photonic systems for future communication technologies. I am always eager to be challenged with new and exciting problems while learning new skills in solving them.
